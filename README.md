## General info
FanGo letâ€™s NFL fans track their travels across the country supporting their favorite team or expanding their ultimate fan status. The app downloads and stores NFL team stadium info from SportsDataIO. FanGo allows users to select whether they have been to each stadium, add photos from their photo library, and add/edit notes from their trip (favorite restaurants/things to do in the area).

4. When you tap the add button, you can upload pictures from your photo library from your trip to this city/stadium.

6. If you press the add/edit notes from your trip, you can document any useful information from your trip (places to eat, things to do, experiences you had, etc.) that you might want for the future.
